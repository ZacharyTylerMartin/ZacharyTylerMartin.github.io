        <h3>Education</h3>
        <div>
            <p>I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina, graduating Magna Cum Laude, with a GPA of 3.719. In an effort to keep my skills sharp, I became an Oracle Certified Associate, Java Programmer (OCAJP).</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Skillset</h3>
        <div>
            <p class="about">I'm a new software-engineer looking to get my foot in the door and help you and your clients to agilely adapt to your ever-changing software needs.</p>
            <p> I am more experienced with Java than any other language or technology, but it's not the end of my knowledge. I am familiar with C#, Javascript, and Jquery as well.</p>
            <p>
                My experience with these languages is less than my experience with Java, but I am committed to keeping my skills sharp and believe that I can become more proficient<br />
                in these languages if the situation warranted it.
            </p>
            <p>SQL is something that I know in a basic way, but again, I am confident in my ability to learn it and other languages and technologies.</p>
